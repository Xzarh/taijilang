### Thanks
Thanks to the people who make the great things, I learned so much from them:

[John McCarthy](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/), he invented the great language - [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp), Taijilang follows the spirit of lisp in the heart.

[Jeremy Ashkenas](http://ashkenas.com/), he [created coffee-script](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript). I used [coffee-script](http://coffeescript.org/) to write Tajilang and learned a lot from it on how to create an elegant language and compile it to javascript.

[Ryan Dahl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY), he created [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Taijilang runs on node.js.

[Santosh Rajan](http://santoshrajan.com/), he created [lispyscript](github.com/santoshrajan/lispyscript), from which I got the instant spark to creating Taijilang.

[TJ Holowaychuk](http://tjholowaychuk.com/), he shines the two letter "TJ" because of [so many great stuffs he have made](https://github.com/visionmedia), and I am honored to use .tj as the extension name of taijilang code file.

I need thank to many other people and the stuffs made by them, too, although I can not list everyone of them here.
 
At last, I'll thank to my family. 

**Let it go, let's start the game of throne, write a song of ice and fire in the taiji language.**
