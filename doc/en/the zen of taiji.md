### the zen of taiji

    Being and Not-being grow out of one another,
    Difficult and easy complete one another,
    How to distinct more from less, good from bad?
    What is right or wrong, and what is cause and effect?
    When people interact with the machine,
    the habits come into being naturally.
    The dao and name being told are never eternal,
    let us exporle one that rules all.
