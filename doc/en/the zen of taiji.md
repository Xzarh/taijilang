太极之禅

有无相生
难易相成
多少善恶
是非因果
人机相应
习惯自然
道名非常
一以贯之

the zen of taiji
Being and Not-being grow out of one another,
Difficult and easy complete one another,
How to distinct more from less, good from bad?
What is right or wrong, and what is cause and effect?
When people interact with the machine,
the habits come into being naturally.
The dao and name being told are never eternal,
let us exporle one that rules all.
